Keyword ranking positions are simple to understand. Basically, what rankings measure is where your site shows up on the search page for any given keyword.<br><br>
<b><i>How Are Keyword Rankings Determined?</i></b><br>
Its pretty straightforward: your page is ranked according to how relevant it is to the searchers query. <br><br>

<b><i>Why Should You Care About Checking Your Keyword Ranking Position?</i></b><br>
The websites on the first search engine results page receive almost 95% of web traffic, so not many people are going to find you on that 5th page.
Tracking your average keyword rankings is a straightforward way of monitoring your site performance and comparing it to that of your competitors. <br><br>
<b><i>What Keywords Should I Care About Tracking?</i></b>

So, lets say you have done your research and put together an awesome keyword list. Obviously, with all these search terms you want to show up for, manually searching each term and marking your sites position regularly would be a miserable and futile task, especially considering that rankings can vary by your exact location and your search history. There has to be a better way to check your Google rankings, right?<br><br>

<b><i>How Do You Check Your Website Ranking on Google, Bing, and Yahoo?</i></b><br>

You can choose from keyword search ranking tools that are free or tools that are paid. Keep in mind that you get what you pay for : using exclusively free tools can give you spotty results that dont always reflect your true rankings that well, though they do come in handy for some uses. Paid tools tend to make it easier to automate keyword rank reporting and usually take some of the legwork out of tracking your keyword rankings so you can sit back and watch your rankings roll in.<br><br>

Google itself is a great place to go when looking for keyword rank tracking tools : you can probably find the perfect tool to fit your budget and your tracking priorities.<br>
